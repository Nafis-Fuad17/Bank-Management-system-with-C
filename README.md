# Bank-Management-system-with-C
The Bank Management System project aims to develop a software application using the C programming language for automating various banking operations. The system facilitates customer management, account management, transaction processing, and report generation, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and security within a bank. The purpose of this project report is to provide a comprehensive overview of the Bank Management System.
The Bank Management System is implemented in the C programming language. The system utilizes an array of structures to store account information, with each structure representing an account. The data is stored persistently using a file system, with the accounts data being saved to a text file.
The Bank Management System is designed using a modular approach, with the following key function. Such as ReadAccountsnumber, SaveAccounts, AccountCreate, DepositMoney, WithdrawMoney, CheckBalance, TransferMoney, PrintStatement, ChangeAccountName, DeleteAccount, ViewAllAccounts .These allows the system to do such works in these programs like create account, deposit or withdraw money, transfer money and view all account for the employer. User can also check their balance by using this function.
The system incorporates basic error handling mechanisms, which can help minimize errors in account management and transaction processing. It validates user input, checks for potential issues, and provides appropriate error messages, reducing the likelihood of mistakes. This system also has some security features for the user who can have an access to the program. We have created this by using username and password. Along with this this program also has switch case variable for menu-driven interface that makes the system user-friendly.
